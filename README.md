# Final project - Pay it backwards!

## Project description

Many of us have been recipients of a charitable 'Pay it forwards' moment. Maybe someone paid for your coffee, helped you change a tire, or bought you lunch. I wanted to bring a similar mechanic to crypto with this 'Pay it backwards' contract where you can help an anonymous someone out. 

### Directory Structure

- the test directory contains the unit tests which can be run with truffle test
- the client directory holds the frontend (built in react and hosted using github pages)
-- cd into the client directory
-- npm run start
- the contract directory holds the smart contracts which dictate the logic of the pay it backwards project
- the migrations directory holds files used for migrating the above contracts
